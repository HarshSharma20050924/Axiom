# AXIOM: Strategic Intent & Vision

## The Philosophy: Quiet Luxury
AXIOM is not a marketplace; it is an archive of intent. We reject the noise of traditional e-commerce (urgency, clutter, gamification) in favor of **Atmosphere**. 

In the physical world, purchasing a Vitra chair or a Leica camera is a sensory experience. In the digital realm, AXIOM replicates this via "Viscous Interaction"—interfaces that feel heavy, deliberate, and substantial.

## Experience Architecture
1.  **Atmosphere > Conversion:** We accept lower impulse buy rates for higher "Engagement Depth." A user who spends 10 minutes reading a supply chain passport is more valuable than one who clicks "Buy" in 10 seconds.
2.  **Curated Collections:** We do not have "categories." Items are grouped by narrative (e.g., "The Tokyo Minimalist," "Mid-Century Graphite").
3.  **Acquisition, not Consumption:** The button says "Acquire." It implies responsibility and stewardship, not mere consumption.

## The North Star: Engagement Depth
We depreciate CTR (Click-Through Rate). Our primary KPI is **Interaction Density**—the time spent interacting with 3D assets, reading provenance data, and exploring the Digital Product Passport (DPP).
